To dream the impossible dream..
To fight the unbeatable foe..
To bear the unbearable sorrow..
To run where the brave dare not to go..
To love the pure and chaste from a far..
To right the unforgivable wrong..
To try when your arms are too weary..
To reach that unreachable star..

This is my quest.. to follow that star..
No matter how place.. no matter how far..
To fight for the right..
without questions.. without pause..

To be willing to march into hell..
For heavenly cause....
